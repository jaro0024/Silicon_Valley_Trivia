 2) once start button is clicked, start 30 second timer and show 1 question and 4 options - only one can be clicked (timer)
 3) once an answered is clicked, timer stops and evaluate if answer is correct or not (click event and win/lose function)
 4) if correct, show page that says correct and a giphy (if / else statement)
 5) else if is incorrect, show page that says incorrect, gives the correct answer and a giphy (if / else statement)
 6) else, no answer before timer is up, show page that says you ran out of time, gives the correct answer and a giphy (if / else statement)
 7) after 5 seconds, go to next question (timer) (for loop)
 8) every time it evaluates if the answer is correct, incorrect or not answered, increment the respective variable (++)
